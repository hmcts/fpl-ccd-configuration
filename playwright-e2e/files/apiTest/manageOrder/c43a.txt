Warning
Where a Special Guardianship Order is in force no person may cause the child to be known by
a new surname or remove the child from the United Kingdom without either the written consent
of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the Court.
However, this does not prevent the removal of a child for a period of less than 3 months, by its
special guardian(s) (Section 14C (3) and (4) Children Act 1989).
It may be a criminal offence under the Child Abduction Act 1984 to remove the child from the
United Kingdom without leave of the Court.
By consent 
The Court orders that Joe Bloggs is appointed as special guardian for the child.

Notice
Any person with parental responsibility for a child may obtain advice on what can be done
to prevent the issue of a passport to the child. They should write to Glasgow CPST, HMPO
Glasgow, 96 Milton Street, Glasgow, G4 0BT or email Glasgowcaveats@hmpo.gov.uk.
