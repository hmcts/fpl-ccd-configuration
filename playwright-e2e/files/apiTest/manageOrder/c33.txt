Care order restrictions
While a care order is in place, no one can change the child’s surname or take the child out of
the UK unless they have written consent from all people with parental responsibility, or
permission from the Court.
Taking the child from the UK without this consent or permission might be an offence under the
Child Abduction Act 1984.
Swansea City Council has been given parental responsibility under this care order and may
take the child out of the UK for up to 1 month without this consent or permission.
The Court orders that the child is placed in the care of Swansea City Council until the end
of the proceedings or until a further order is made.
I need an exclusion because of X,Y and Z Further details.
