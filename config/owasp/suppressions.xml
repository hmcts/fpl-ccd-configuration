      <![CDATA[
        insecure randomness vulnerability when using SecureRandomFactoryBean#setSeed to configure a SecureRandom
        instance. In order to be impacted, an honest application must provide a seed and make the resulting random
        material available to an attacker for inspection. Waiting for an update of org.springframework.boot to address
        this issue.
        This one seems to be false positive targetting now spring security 5.0.5
