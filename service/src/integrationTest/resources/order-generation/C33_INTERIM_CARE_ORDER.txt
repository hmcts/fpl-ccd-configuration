Care order restrictions

While a care order is in place, no one can change the child’s surname or take the child out of the UK
unless they have written consent from all people with parental responsibility, or permission from the court.

Taking the child from the UK without this consent or permission might be an offence under the Child
Abduction Act 1984.

LocalAuthorityName has been given parental responsibility under this care order and may take the child
out of the UK for up to 1 month without this consent or permission.

The Court orders that the child is placed in the care of LocalAuthorityName until the end of
the proceedings or until a further order is made.
