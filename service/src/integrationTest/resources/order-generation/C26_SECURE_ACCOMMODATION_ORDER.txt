By consent, The Court authorises LocalAuthorityName to keep the child in secure accommodation for 4 months from the date of this order.

This order has been made on the ground that the child has a history of absconding and is likely to abscond from any other accommodation, and if the child absconds he is likely to suffer significant harm.

The Court was satisfied that the child, not being legally represented, has been informed of their right to apply for legal aid and having had the opportunity to apply, had refused or failed to apply.
