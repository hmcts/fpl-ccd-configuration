Child in the case

Kenny Kruger Born 1 January 2010

Warning

Where a Special Guardianship Order is in force no person may cause the child to be known by
a new surname or remove the child from the United Kingdom without either the written consent
of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the court. However,
this does not prevent the removal of a child for a period of less than 3 months, by its special
guardian(s) (Section 14C (3) and (4) Children Act 1989).

It may be a criminal offence under the Child Abduction Act 1984 to remove the child from the
United Kingdom without leave of the court.

By consent

The Court orders that Remy Respondy, Otto Otherman are appointed as special guardian for the child.
Some further directions.

Notice

Any person with parental responsibility for a child may obtain advice on what can be done to
prevent the issue of a passport to the child. They should write to The United Kingdom
Passport Agency, Globe House, 89 Eccleston Square, LONDON, SW1V 1PN.
