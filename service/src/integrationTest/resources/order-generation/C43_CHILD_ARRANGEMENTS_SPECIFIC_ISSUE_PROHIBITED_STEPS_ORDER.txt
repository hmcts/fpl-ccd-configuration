Warning

Where a Child Arrangements Order is in force and the arrangements regulated by it consist of,
or include, arrangements which relate to either or both (a) with whom the child concerned shall
live and(b) when the child shall live with any person, no person may cause the child to be
known by a new surname or remove the child from the United Kingdom without the written
consent of every person with parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the Court.
However, this does not prevent the removal of the child, for a period of less than 1 month, by a
person named in the Child Arrangements Order as a person with whom the child shall live
(Sections13(1), (2) and (4) Children Act 1989).
It may be a criminal offence under the Child Abduction Act 1984 to remove the child from the
United Kingdom without the leave of the Court.
Where a Child Arrangements Order is in force: if you do not comply with a provision of this
Child Arrangements Order–
(a) you may be held in contempt of Court and be committed to prison or fined; and/or
(b) the Court may make an order requiring you to undertake unpaid work ("an enforcement
order") and/or an order that you pay financial compensation.
